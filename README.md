NetDeck is a powerful networking plugin for [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader) that provides advanced networking capabilities for Steam Deck and handheld gaming PCs. Turn your device into a versatile networking tool with MAC address spoofing, WiFi hotspot creation, and internet sharing capabilities.

## Features

### MAC Address Spoofing
- **Privacy Protection**: Randomize your device's network identity
- **Safe Rollback**: Automatic restoration of original MAC address

### WiFi Access Point Creation
- **Dual-Adapter Hotspot**: Create WiFi hotspot using USB adapter while maintaining internet connection
- **Secure Anonymous Networks**: Generate random, non-identifying SSIDs (e.g., "amazing-falcon-7834")
- **Hidden SSID Support**: Create invisible networks for enhanced privacy
- **Cryptographically Secure Passwords**: 10-character randomized passwords with regeneration on demand

### Internet Sharing & Bridging
- **NAT-based Internet Sharing**: Share your primary connection through the hotspot
- **Client Monitoring**: Real-time display of connected devices with IP, MAC, and hostname
- **Dynamic Subnet Configuration**: Configurable IP ranges (default: 192.168.5.0/24)
- **Automatic Routing**: Seamless internet access for connected clients

### Security & Privacy Features
- **Randomized SSID Generation**: Word-pair combinations that don't identify your device
- **No Telemetry**: All networking operations are local to your device

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Steam Deck or compatible handheld PC running SteamOS
- [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader) installed
- USB WiFi adapter (recommended for hotspot functionality)
- Root access for network configuration

### Installation

1. Download the latest `NetDeck.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/fewtarius/NetDeck/releases)
2. Extract to `/home/deck/homebrew/plugins/NetDeck/`
3. Restart Decky Loader
4. NetDeck will appear in your plugin list

### First Use
1. Open NetDeck from the Decky overlay
2. **For MAC Spoofing**: Select your primary interface and configure MAC address
3. **For Hotspot**: Insert USB WiFi adapter, configure network settings, and start access point
4. **For Internet Sharing**: Enable NAT bridging to share internet with hotspot clients

## Detailed Configuration

### MAC Address Spoofing Setup

```bash
# NetDeck will automatically detect your primary WiFi interface
# Default: wlan0 (built-in adapter)
```

1. **Select Interface**: Choose your primary WiFi adapter (usually `wlan0`)
2. **Configure MAC**: Enter custom MAC or use random generation
3. **Apply Changes**: NetDeck handles network reconnection automatically
4. **Verify**: Check network status to confirm successful spoofing

### Hotspot Configuration

```bash
# Recommended Setup:
# Primary: wlan0 (built-in) - Internet connection
# Hotspot: wlan1 (USB adapter) - Access point
```

1. **Dual Adapter Setup**:
   - Keep built-in adapter (`wlan0`) connected to internet
   - Use USB adapter (`wlan1`) for hotspot creation

2. **Network Settings**:
   - **SSID**: Auto-generated anonymous name (e.g., "clever-hawk-2847")
   - **Password**: 10-character secure random password
   - **Band**: 2.4GHz (recommended for compatibility)
   - **Hidden**: Optional for enhanced privacy

3. **Advanced Configuration**:
   - **Subnet**: Configure IP range (default: 192.168.5.0/24)
   - **Gateway**: Automatic (.1 address of subnet)
   - **DHCP Range**: .2 to .20 of configured subnet

### Internet Sharing Setup

1. **Enable NAT Bridging**: Toggle internet sharing in NetDeck interface
2. **Automatic Routing**: NetDeck configures iptables rules automatically
3. **Client Access**: Connected devices receive internet through your primary connection
4. **Monitoring**: View connected clients in real-time

## Use Cases

### Gaming Parties & LAN Events
- **Problem**: Need local network for multiplayer gaming
- **Solution**: Create isolated gaming network with NetDeck
- **Benefit**: Low-latency local gaming with internet access

### Device Internet Sharing
- **Problem**: Limited internet access for multiple devices
- **Solution**: Share Steam Deck's connection via NetDeck hotspot
- **Benefit**: All devices get internet through one connection

### Streaming & Content
- **Problem**: Need stable connection for streaming devices
- **Solution**: Bridge Steam Deck's connection to other devices
- **Benefit**: Reliable internet for streaming sticks, phones, etc.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### MAC Spoofing Not Working
- **Verify interface**: Ensure selected interface exists and is active
- **Check permissions**: NetDeck requires root access for MAC changes
- **Network restart**: Some networks require full disconnection/reconnection

#### Hotspot Creation Fails
- **USB adapter**: Verify USB WiFi adapter is detected (`iw dev`)
- **Interface conflicts**: Ensure both adapters are available
- **NetworkManager**: Check if NetworkManager is managing all interfaces

#### No Internet Through Hotspot
- **NAT configuration**: Verify iptables rules are applied correctly
- **Primary connection**: Ensure primary adapter maintains internet access
- **Routing**: Check IP forwarding is enabled (`sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward`)

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check WiFi interfaces
iw dev

# Verify network connections
nmcli connection show

# Check IP configuration
ip addr show

# Monitor network traffic
tcpdump -i wlan1

# Check iptables rules
iptables -t nat -L
iptables -L FORWARD
```

### Log Analysis
```bash
# Plugin-specific logs
journalctl -u plugin_loader | grep -i netdeck

# Network manager logs
journalctl -u NetworkManager --since "10 minutes ago"

# System network logs
dmesg | grep -i "wlan\|wifi\|network"
```
